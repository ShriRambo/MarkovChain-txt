Take this kiss upon the brow! 

And, in parting from you now, 

Thus much let me avow-

You are not wrong, who deem

That my days have been a dream; 

Yet if hope has flown away

In a night, or in a day, 

In a vision, or in none, 

Is it therefore the less gone? 

All that we see or seem

Is but a dream within a dream. 

I stand amid the roar

Of a surf-tormented shore, 

And I hold within my hand

Grains of the golden sand-

How few! yet how they creep

Through my fingers to the deep, 

While I weep- while I weep! 

O God! can I not grasp

Them with a tighter clasp? 

O God! can I not save

One from the pitiless wave? 

Is all that we see or seem

But a dream within a dream? 

Lo! 'tis a gala night 

Within the lonesome latter years! 

An angel throng, bewinged, bedight 

In veils, and drowned in tears, 

Sit in a theatre, to see 

A play of hopes and fears, 

While the orchestra breathes fitfully 

The music of the spheres. 

Mimes, in the form of God on high, 

Mutter and mumble low, 

And hither and thither fly- 

Mere puppets they, who come and go 

At bidding of vast formless things 

That shift the scenery to and fro, 

Flapping from out their Condor wings 

Invisible Woe! 

That motley drama- oh, be sure 

It shall not be forgot! 

With its Phantom chased for evermore, 

By a crowd that seize it not, 

Through a circle that ever returneth in 

To the self-same spot, 

And much of Madness, and more of Sin, 

And Horror the soul of the plot. 

But see, amid the mimic rout 

A crawling shape intrude! 

A blood-red thing that writhes from out 

The scenic solitude! 

It writhes!- it writhes!- with mortal pangs 

The mimes become its food, 

And seraphs sob at vermin fangs 

In human gore imbued. 

Out- out are the lights- out all! 

And, over each quivering form, 

The curtain, a funeral pall, 

Comes down with the rush of a storm, 

While the angels, all pallid and wan, 

Uprising, unveiling, affirm 

That the play is the tragedy, "Man," 

And its hero the Conqueror Worm. 

Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow

Of crystal, wandering water,

Thou art an emblem of the glow

Of beauty the unhidden heart

The playful maziness of art

In old Alberto's daughter;

But when within thy wave she looks

Which glistens then, and trembles

Why, then, the prettiest of brooks

Her worshipper resembles;

For in my heart, as in thy stream,

Her image deeply lies

The heart which trembles at the beam

Of her soul-searching eyes.

GAILY bedight,

A gallant knight,

In sunshine and in shadow,

Had journeyed long,

Singing a song,

In search of Eldorado.

But he grew old 

This knight so bold 

And o'er his heart a shadow

Fell as he found

No spot of ground

That looked like Eldorado.

And, as his strength

Failed him at length,

He met a pilgrim shadow 

"Shadow," said he,

"Where can it be 

This land of Eldorado?"

"Over the Mountains

Of the Moon,

Down the Valley of the Shadow,

Ride, boldly ride,"

The shade replied, 

"If you seek for Eldorado!"
